# 🏨 Hotel Reservation System

## Project Description:-

The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based application developed to efficiently manage hotel room reservations and guest information. The system provides a structured and reliable way to handle reservation operations such as booking rooms, viewing existing reservations, updating guest details, and removing cancelled bookings.

This project demonstrates the practical use of Core Java concepts, JDBC, and MySQL database integration to perform real-time data storage and retrieval. It is designed as a console-based application, making it lightweight, easy to use, and suitable for small to medium-scale hotel management scenarios.
